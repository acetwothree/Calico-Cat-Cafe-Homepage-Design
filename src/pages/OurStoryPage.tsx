            The Calico Cat Cafe is the passion project of Benjamin Hudes and Dora Govorko, a couple from South Jersey on a mission to bring a unique and comforting space to the community. What began as a simple idea blossomed into a full-scale adventure fueled by a love for cats, a spirit of entrepreneurship, and an incredible wave of community support.

            The inspiration for the cafe struck during a trip to Hawaii, where Ben and Dora first experienced the joy of a cat cafe. For Dora, a lifelong cat lover who grew up visiting pet stores just to be with them, the idea was a dream come true. For Ben, a recent convert to the feline fandom, the passion began when he moved in with Dora and her cat, Couscous. They later adopted their second cat, Chicken, together, solidifying their shared love for cats.

            After graduating from Rowan University with a degree in entrepreneurship, Ben decided to take a leap of faith with Dora. They signed a lease on a space in Oaklyn, New Jersey, and with a shared motto of "we're just going to figure it out," they began the journey of building the cafe from the ground up.

            They quickly found they weren't alone in their mission. What started as a solo DIY project transformed into a community effort, with over 100 volunteers offering their time and skills. Local artists have filled the walls and ceiling with vibrant, unique cat paintings, and construction workers have helped with tasks that Ben and Dora admit they could not have done alone. The cafe is not just being built by Ben and Dora; it's being built by the community.

            The Calico Cat Cafe will be more than just a place to grab a self-serve coffee and a bowl of ramen. It will be a sanctuary where people can relax, study, and play games while surrounded by friendly felines. In partnership with the Homeward Bound animal shelter, all the cats in our lounge will be available for adoption, giving them a chance to find their forever homes.

            Our cafe will be a place where visitors, especially children, can learn how to interact with cats and understand their unique personalities. We believe that a cat cafe can be an important educational space, teaching empathy and kindness toward animals.

            We're incredibly excited to welcome you to our cafe, built with love, community, and a lot of purrs. We hope you'll feel right at home with us and our feline friends.
